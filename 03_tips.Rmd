## Manipulating Dates

### Day of year (DOY) to Date

```{r}
# note that R uses a 0 based index for dates only
# this means it starts counting at 0 rather than 1 when working with dates
as.Date(0, origin = "2016-01-01")

# note that R uses a 0 based index
as.Date(1, origin = "2016-01-01")

# figure out the date for day 189
as.Date(189, origin = "2016-01-01")
```
