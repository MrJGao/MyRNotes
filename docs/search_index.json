I may create some text my own or just copy from other places and label the origins. To write this document, I refered Authoring Books with R Markdown. So, thanks to the authors who created bookdown and wrote the awesome tutorials. Use bookdown::render_book() to render the book to HTML format.

More tips can be found there! To number and refer to equations, put them in the equation environments and assign labels to them using the syntax (\\#eq:label), e.g., \\begin{equation} f\\left(k\\right) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k\\left(1-p\\right)^{n-k} (\\#eq:binom) \\end{equation} It renders the equation below: \\[\\begin{equation} f\\left(k\\right) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k\\left(1-p\\right)^{n-k} \\tag{2.1} \\end{equation}\\] You may refer to it using \\@ref(eq:binom), e.g., see Equation (2.1).

If the figure width/height can be changed or if the axis labels can be rotated using las parameter, thats fine. But sometimes, the labels are not long texts, we believe showing them all wouldnt make them overlap with each other. In this case, we could reduce the gap between labels to force R showing all axis labels. We can use gap.axis parameter to achieve this goal. gap.axis works for the manual axis() function as well as some plot functions such as boxplot(). Normally, I would use gap.axis = 0.01 as the value to plot x axis labels.
