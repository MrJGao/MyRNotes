This is a repo for hosting [MyRNotes](https:mrjgao.github.io/myrnotes), which is a `bookdown` project. 

I refered [Authoring Books with R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/markdown-extensions-by-bookdown.html) to learn `bookdown` and how to publish the book on Github. So, thanks to the authors who created `bookdown` and wrote the awesome tutorials.
