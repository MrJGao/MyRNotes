# Notes for R plots

## Plotting rasters using `raster` package

### Arguments for plotting rasters

The arguments used in `raster` package's `plot` function:

Common tweaks:

The `plot` function also supports:
- Horizontal legend bar
- Zooming in to an extent of the raster
- Interpolation of the raster plot
- Use `zlim` to plot several raster images with the same scale and a single legend

Additionally, `rasterVis` package provides useful raster plotting functions (check [this website](https://oscarperpinan.github.io/rastervis/)).


## Customize the appearance of plots

### Axis

Sometimes there's not enough space for R to show all axis labels, e.g., beacause the figure is too narrow, R would hide some axis labels but this is not we want. If the figure width/height can be changed or if the axis labels can be rotated using `las` parameter, that's fine. But sometimes, the labels are not long texts, we believe showing them all wouldn't make them overlap with each other. In this case, we could reduce the gap between labels to force R showing all axis labels. We can use `gap.axis` parameter to achieve this goal. `gap.axis` works for the manual `axis()` function as well as some plot functions such as `boxplot()`. Normally, I would use `gap.axis = 0.01` as the value to plot x axis labels.
